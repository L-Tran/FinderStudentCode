| Oct 30 | 2-3pm | We had most of a class period to work, so I started to brainstorm because I wanted to use V1 to think of an original solution. At first, I had no idea how I was going to code this, but had an idea of using a hashset. However, because hashsets are not allowed for V1, I wanted to make my own implementation using hashing. Hannah though of the smart idea of hashing the keys and then putting them into a TST. I copied and pasted my code from previous problems sets. |
