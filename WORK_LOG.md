| Oct 30 |    2-3pm    | We had most of a class period to work, so I started to brainstorm because I wanted to use V1 to think of an original solution. At first, I had no idea how I was going to code this, but had an idea of using a hashset. However, because hashsets are not allowed for V1, I wanted to make my own implementation using hashing. Hannah though of the smart idea of hashing the keys and then putting them into a TST. I copied and pasted my code from previous problems sets. |

I had to change some of the data types in the TST & TSTNode class because instead of a word, it was for the hashes which were numbers. After changing a couple values and functions so that they return value at the key, my code worked! And it worked first try which is pretty rare for me. I am honestly very proud of myself and I am happy how fast I completed this. |
