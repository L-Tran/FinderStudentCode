At first, I had no idea how I was going to code this, but had an idea of using a hashset. However, because hashsets are not allowed for V1, I wanted to make my own implementation using hashing. Hannah though of the smart idea of hashing the keys and then putting them into a TST. I copied and pasted my code from previous problems sets. |

I had to change some of the data types in the TST & TSTNode class because instead of a word, it was for the hashes which were numbers. After changing a couple values and functions so that they return value at the key, my code worked! And it worked first try which is pretty rare for me. I am honestly very proud of myself and I am happy how fast I completed this. |

Mr. Blick gave me a pretty good explanation that I wanted to find a relatively smaller number that would not be so small that I would have to keep increasing the table size. We decided a number around a 1000. I also needed this number to be prime to prevent the amount of collisions so I picked 997. Then, I started working on my add and get functions. Linear probing was much easier to implement then I thought it would be (we will see what errors and problems I run into below). |
| Nov 5  |   5-5:30pm    | I finished my code! However, it was not as simple as just implementing it as I ran into some issues for the add, get and resize function. First, I was confused on how to start my resize function.  Remembering back to what Mr. Blick said about just linearly adding the elements back into the table, I thought that I could just use a for loop and copy the indexes of the previous table in the new table. After some thought and errors, I realized I should not do this because when more vales are added to the table, the original values should be found a different spots in the table, so I just used my add function to re add the values. I also needed to not just multiple by table by 2 but also add one to lower the chance of collisions. Next, my add function. For the most, it was correct, but I forgot to increment n every time and at first it was in the beginning of the function where it should be at the end after a successful insertion. Also, I ran into some trouble with the wrapping around because I would go out of bounds, but I just found it easier to mod by the table size which I also applied to the get function. Finally, the get function. I had a bit of trouble with the main while loop and the if statement inside. At first, I only had a while loop, but this would not accurately return the key because there was not comparison to the key stored at the keyHash value. Then, I put that into the while loop, but there was no where to put the check for the null. Third time is the charm so when I included both, my code started working. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
